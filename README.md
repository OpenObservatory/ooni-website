Assuming you have node and yarn installed, run:

```
yarn install
```

Note: If you encounter issues with the install process getting stuck while
installing `sharp`, try installing node-gyp globally with `npm install
node-gyp` and re-running the above command.

To start the dev server run:

```
yarn run develop
```
